## 2. Features
Here are the key features of this project:

- A Algorithm*: The program uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from start (A) to goal (B).
- Heuristic-Based Search: Leverages the Manhattan distance heuristic to efficiently explore paths.
- Graphical Output: Generates a .png image that visually represents:
  - The maze structure.
  - Explored states.
- The optimal solution path.
- Customizable Mazes: Supports user-defined maze files in plain text format.
- Error Handling: Ensures the maze has valid start and goal points and gracefully handles edge cases.

## 4. Requirements
Ensure the following are installed:
- Python 3.x
- Pillow library for generating images (pip install pillow)
- Prepare a maze file in plain text format, like `maze1.txt`, `maze2.txt` or `maze3.txt`
